# CreateProject

### Introduction 
Everytime I work on a any Idea, I need to perform a fixed tasks. This project automates those tasks and creates a fresh project for me. What I mean by creating a project is:
1. I go to my projects folder and create a new foler. 
2. I make a github repository with the same name. 
1. I perform some things like git init. 

Sometimes I am excited to work on the idea and other times, I am lazy to create a github repo, so  end up not putting them on github and thus I lost I lot of data. 
Now I just have to run one command from my terminal and it does everything for me!!
```bash
create DemoProjects
```

#### Idea
This Idea I got from kalle hallden. He did the same thing but he didn't taught how. He provided his code but I didn't understand a bit so I started with very begining.

#### Resources:
I learnt three things for this project:
1. git: I learnt this from _codewithharry_

#### Using Code
You can't just download the code and use itl. But yes, you can customize it with your way. Like you can just chnage the username and password for your github account username and password. 
Changing the path of chrome driver!
Changing the some things in create command. 

I advice you, if you want to use this idea. First go through all youtube videos, I have listed above, then try making it yourself and you can use my code as reference.
